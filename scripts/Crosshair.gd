# TODO how to determine how much both areas overlap?
#Â A: consider dividing the current collision shape into at least 3, whilst maintaining
# the same position - i.e. the 3 new shapes should form the current one. this way we
# can say that it's only a hit if the crosshair is overlapping all 3 areas (or 2)
# instead of just one
