# TODO how to determine how much both areas overlap?
#Â A: consider dividing the current collision shape into at least 3, whilst maintaining
# the same position - i.e. the 3 new shapes should form the current one. this way we
# can say that it's only a hit if the crosshair is overlapping all 3 areas (or 2)
# instead of just one


# to be connected to Target's area_entered signal, letting us know that an area2d
# has entered its (Target's) area2d. we don't actually check which area2d it is
# because at any moment in the game, we only have two overlapping area2d
# (crosshair and target areas)
